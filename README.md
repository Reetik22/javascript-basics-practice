# JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains my JavaScript practice work, including basic exercises and mini projects. The goal is to improve my understanding of core JavaScript concepts like:

- Variables and Data Types
- Functions and Scope
- Arrays and Loops
- DOM Manipulation
- Events and Event Listeners
- ES6+ Features (Arrow Functions, Spread, Destructuring, etc.)

## Folder Structure

- `basics/` – Fundamental syntax and core concepts
- `dom/` – DOM manipulation exercises
- `projects/` – Small interactive projects like To-Do List, Calculator, etc.

## How to Run

Just clone the repo and open the HTML files in your browser, or use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code.
